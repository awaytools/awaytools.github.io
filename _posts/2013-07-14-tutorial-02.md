## Description
A look at some of the built in geometry creation tools in Away Builder that can help you arrange basic scenes without the need for imported models. 

### Tutorial Resources

You can follow along with the tutorial by downloading the accompanying [assets zip](/awaybuilder/tutorial-02/AwayBuilderTutorial02_SampleFiles.zip). It includes several texture files in jpg format and an AS3 application class that you can use to preview your results from inside an Away3D project.

### Topics Covered

- Using the built in geometry primitives in Away3D to create objects in a scene
- Using a SkyBox primitive and Cube Texture to create a convincing 360 panorama background image
- Setting up a light source to simulate a sky dome
- Applying a Environment Map effect to an Away3D material.
- Duplicating an object in the scene.
